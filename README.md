# Downloads Simplified

The downloads directory is usually the most cluttered directory on many Windows user's computers, however this becomes annoying and unmagable whenever you are looking an older file, for which where you know the type, but can't find it buried under 100s of other random files.

This program sorts your downloads directory on **Windows** into easily managable files!

# How to start sorting your downloads

In the ***output*** folder, there is a file **Downloads Simplified.exe**
Execute this folder to begin sorting your downloads. Be sure to check the next steps so that Windows Defender doesn't remove it.

#### ***WARNING:*** 
**This folder is automatically recognized as a Trojan virus by windows defender, and a few other programs.** This program is ***not*** a virus, it was compiled with the [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/) tool, and this is a common issue occurence when using this *(you can scan the .exe with [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to see that it is only detected by a few antivirus systems)*.

#### To stop the detection follow these steps:

1. Run the **Downloads Simplified.exe** file.  
2. Observe the Windows Defender Notification (if you have notifications off, you will need to open the notifications sidebar or open Windows Defender in settings)
3. Click the false positive Trojan that it has detected and select: **Always allow > Start Actions**  

***If the program is not running (which you can check in task manager), and is not in your startup folder or the location you downlaoded it, Windows Defender has already deleted it. Simply run the program and repeat the steps quicker.***

**That's it! Your downloads will now be sorted!**

# In what way are your files sorted?

##### The program sorts your downloads into 10 different folders:

**_FOLDERS**: Windows File Folder Types. 
**Apps**: Executable files like setups/installers.
**Audio**: Audio type files.
**Images**: Image type files.
**Pdf**: PDF type files.                                
**Text**: Text/Code type files.
**Work**: All offic type files.
**Zipped**: Zipped/rar/tar type files.
**Misc**: Any file that didn't qualify as any of the prior types.

**This is what your Downloads folder will look like! So organized!**

# **Some things to consider**

1. This program nests itself in your startup folder, so that it runs whenever you turn your computer on.
2. It automatically checks your downloads folder for new files every 6 hours while your computer is on.
